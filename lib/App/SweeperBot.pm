=head1 NAME

App::SweeperBot - Play windows minesweeper, automatically!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	C:\Path\To\Distribution> SweeperBot.exe

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is alpha code, and released for testing and demonstration
purposes only.  It is still under active development.

Using this code for playing minesweeper on a production basis is
strongly discouraged.

=head2 spawn_minesweeper

	$sweeperbot->spawn_minesweeper;

Attempts to spawn a new minesweeper instance.  Returns the
C<Win32::Process> object on success, or throws an exception
on error.

=head2 locate_minesweeper

	$sweeperbot->locate_minesweeper;

Locates the first minesweeper window that can be found, brings
it into focus, and sets relevant state so that it can be
acessed later.  Must be used before a game can be started
or played.  Should be used if the minesweeper window
changes size or position.

Returns the window ID on success.  Throws an exception on
failure.

	return $id;
}

=head2 click

	$sweeperbot->click($x,$y,$button);

Clicks on ($x,$y) as an I<absolute> position on the screen.
C<$button> is any button as understood by L<Win32::GuiTest>,
usually C<{LEFTCLICK}>, C<{MIDDLECLICK}> or C<{RIGHTCLICK}>.

If not specified, C<$button> defaults to a left-click.

Returns nothing.

=head2 new_game

	$sweeperbot->new_game;

Starts a new game of minesweeper.  C<locate_minesweeper()> must
have been called previously for this to work.

Does not return a value, nor does it check to see if a new game
has been successfully started.

=cut


# TODO: Rather than using the reset variables, we should properly
# calculate the location of our reset button.  We have calibration
# code elsewhere that essentially finds the smiley, we just have to

=head2 focus

	$sweeperbot->focus;

Focuses on t he  minesweeper window by clicking a little left of the
smiley.  Does not check for success.  Returns nothing.

=cut

=head2 capture_square

	my $image = $sweeperbot->capture_square($x,$y);

Captures the square ($x,$y) of the minesweeper board.  (1,1) is
the top-left of the grid.  No checking is done to see if the square
is actually on the board.  Returns the image as an L<Image::Magick>
object.

=head3 Bugs in capture_square

On failure to capture the image, this returns an empty
L<Image::Magick> object.  This is considered a bug; in the future
C<capture_square> will throw an exception on error.

C<capture_square> depends upon calibration routines that are
currently implemented in the L</value> method; calling it before
the first call to L</value> can result in incorrect or inconsistent
results.  In future releases C<capture_square> will automatically
calibrate itself if required.

=cut

# TODO - Win32::Screenshot doesn't check the Image::Magick return
# codes, it just assumes everything works.  We should consider writing
# our own code that _does_ test, since these diagnostics are very
# useful when things go wrong.

}

=head2 value

	my $value = $sweeperbot->value($x,$y);

Returns the value in position ($x,$y) of the board, square
(1,1) is considered the top-left of the grid.  Possible values
are given below:

	0-8		# Number of adjacent mines (0 = empty)
	bomb		# A bomb (only when game lost)
	bomb_hilight	# The bomb we hit (only when game lost)
	flag		# A flag
	unpressed	# An unpressed square

Support of question-marks is not provided, but may be included
in a future version.

Throws an exception on failure.

}

=head2 press

	$sweeperbot->press($x,$y, $button)

Clicks on the square with co-ordinates ($x,$y) using the mouse-button
C<$button>, or left-click by default.  Square (1,1)
is the top-left square.  Does not return a value.

=cut

sub press {

=head2 stomp

	$sweeperbot->stomp($x,$y);

Stomps (middle-clicks) on the square at ($x,$y), normally used to
stand on all squares adjacent to the square specified.  Square (1,1)
is the top-left of the grid.  Does not return a value.

=cut

=head2 flag_mines

	$sweeperbot->flag_mines($game_state,
		[2,3], [7,1], [8,3]
	);

Takes a game state, and a list of location tuples (array-refs),
and marks all of those locations with flags.

The requirement to pass C<$game_state> may be removed in a
future version.

=cut

sub flag_mines {
	my ($this, $game_state, @flag_these) = @_;

=head2 game_over

	if (my $state = $sweeperbot->game_over) {

	}

Checks to see if the game is over by looking at the minesweeper smiley.
Returns C<1> for game over due to a win, C<-1> for game over due to
a loss, and false if the game has not finished.

=head2 make_move


	$sweeperbot->make_move($game_state);

Given a game state, determines the next move(s) that should be made,
and makes them.  By default this uses a very simple process:

=over

=item *

If C<UBER_CHEAT> is set, then cheat.

=item *

If we find a square where the number of adjacent mines matches the
number on the square, L</stomp> on it.

=item *

If the number of adjacent unpressed squares matches the number of 
unknown adjacent mines, then flag them as mines.

=item * 

If all else fails, pick a square at random.  If C<CHEAT> is defined,
and we would have picked a square with a mine, then pick another.

If you want to inherit from this class to change the AI, overriding
this method is the place to do it.

=head2 capture_game_state

Walks over the entire board, capturing the value in each location and
adding it to an array-of-arrays (game-state) structure.  The value
in a particular square can be accessed with:

	$value = $game_state->[$x][$y];

Where (1,1) is considered the top-left of the game board.

=head2 adjacent_mines_for

	my $mines = $sweeperbot->adjacent_mines_for($game_state, $x, $y);

Examines all the squares adjacent to ($x,$y) and returns an
array-ref of tuples for those that have already been flagged
as a mine.

=cut

sub adjacent_mines_for {
	my ($this, $game_state, $x, $y) = @_;
	return $this->mines_at($game_state,
		[$x-1, $y-1],   [$x, $y-1],   [$x+1, $y-1],

		[$x-1, $y+1],   [$x, $y+1],   [$x+1, $y+1],
	);
}

=head2 adjacent_unpressed_for

	my $squares = $sweeperbot->adjacent_unpressed_for($game_state, $x, $y);

Examines all the squares adjacent to ($x,$y) and returns an array-ref
of tuples for those that have not been pressed (and not flagged as a
mine).

=cut

	my ($this, $game_state, $x, $y) = @_;
	return $this->unpressed_list($game_state,
		[$x-1, $y-1],   [$x, $y-1],   [$x+1, $y-1],
		[$x-1, $y  ],                 [$x+1, $y  ],
		[$x-1, $y+1],   [$x, $y+1],   [$x+1, $y+1],
	);
}

=head2 mines_at

	my $mines = $sweeperbot->mines_at($game_state, @locations);

Takes a game state and a list of locations, and returns an array-ref
containing those locations from the list that have been flagged as
a mine.

=cut


sub mines_at {
	my ($this, $game_state, @locations) = @_;

	my $mines = 0;

	foreach my $square (@locations) {
		if ($game_state->[ $square->[0] ][ $square->[1] ] eq "flag") {
			$mines++;
		}
	}
	return $mines;
}

=head2 unpressed_list

	my $unpressed = $this->unpressed-list($game_state, @locations);

Identical to L</mines_at> above, but returns any locations that have
not been pressed (and not flagged as a mine).

=cut

sub unpressed_list {
	my ($this, $game_state, @locations) = @_;

	my @unpressed = grep { ($game_state->[ $_->[0] ][ $_->[1] ] eq "unpressed") } @locations;

	return @unpressed;
}

=head2 enable_cheats

	$sweeperbot->enable_cheats;

Sends the magic C<xyzzy> cheat to minesweeper, which allows us to
determine the contents of a square by examining the top-left pixel
of the entire display.

For this cheat to be used in the default AI, the C<CHEAT> constant
must be set to a true value in the C<App::SweeperBot> source.

=cut

sub enable_cheats {
	SendKeys("xyzzy{ENTER}+ ");

	return;
}

=head2 cheat_is_square_safe

	if ($sweeperbot->cheat_is_square_safe($x,$y) {
		print "($x,$y) looks safe!\n";
	} else {
		print "($x,$y) has a mine underneath.\n";
	}

If cheats are enabled, returns true if the given square looks
safe to step on, or false if it appears to contain a mine.

Note that especially on fast, multi-core systems, it's possible
for this to move the mouse and capture the required pixel before
minesweeper has had a chance to update it.  So if you cheat,
you may sometimes be surprised.

=cut

sub cheat_is_square_safe {
	my ($this, $square) = @_;
	our($l,$t);
	
	MouseMoveAbsPix(
		$l+SQUARE1X+($square->[0]-1)*SQUARE_W+SQUARE_W/2,
		$t+$Square1Y+($square->[1]-1)*SQUARE_H+SQUARE_W/2,
	);

	# Capture our pixel.
	my $pixel =  CaptureRect(0,0,1,1);

	my $signature = $pixel->Get("signature");

	print "Square at @$square has sig of $signature\n" if DEBUG;

	if ($signature eq CHEAT_SAFE) {
		print "This square (@$square) looks safe\n" if DEBUG;
		return 1;
	} elsif ($signature eq CHEAT_UNSAFE) {
		print "This square (@$square) looks dangerous!\n" if DEBUG;
		return;
	} 
	die "Square @$square has unknown cheat-signature\n$signature\n";
}

=head1 BUGS

Plenty.  The code is pretty awful right now.  Anything that could go
wrong probably will.

Use of this program may cause sweeperbot to take control of our
mouse and keyboard, playing minesweeper endlessly for days on end,
and forcing the user to go and do something productive instead.

All methods that require a game-state to be passed will be modified
in the future to be usable without the game-state.  The
C<App::SweeperBot> object itself should be able to retain state.
